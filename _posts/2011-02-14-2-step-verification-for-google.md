Google has that this feature for a while now but it’s only been available for paid Google Apps subscribers.  Now they’re rolling it out for gmail and free Google Apps accounts.  Essentially what this does is gives you an extra layers of security for your Google account.  When you try to log into your Google account from a new computer or device, you will be prompted to provide a security code.  This is kind of similar to how your bank asks you to answer a series of questions when it doesn’t recognize your computer.  Click the link to Gizmodo for an explanation on how to  set it up.  I think it’s great that they’ve added this feature especially since so much of our information is in the cloud these days.
