I recently came across this awesome screen saver called Polar Clock.  The colored circles move in a clockwise direction according to seconds, minutes, hours, day of the week, day of the month, and month.  Screen savers were all the rage ages ago, but they dropped off in popularity some time ago.  I think it would be great to see a resurgence of quality screen savers.  This one is a free download for both Mac and Windows, so definitely check it out!
