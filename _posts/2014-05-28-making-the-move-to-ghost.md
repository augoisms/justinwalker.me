While historically I have not posted to my blog very often, I have decided to move it from a self-hosted Wordpress install over to the hosted blogging platform, [Ghost](https://ghost.org). The Ghost blogging engine itself is open source so you are able to use your hosting of choice, but lately I've really grown to appreciate turn key services. I just pay a small monthly fee and it all "just works."

For the needs of this blog, Wordpress has too many bells and whistles that are not needed, and I really like the simplicity that Ghost provides. The markdown editor with live preview is a real gem.

Hopefully with this change you will also start seeing more posts. My goal is to start posting the various web development solutions that I come across or figure out, especially for the ones where I couldn't find a post anywhere.

I'm excited to get back into posting and to be using Ghost!
