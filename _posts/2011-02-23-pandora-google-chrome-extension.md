This extension is a definite MUST HAVE for any regular Pandora listener.  What makes this extension great is that you don’t have to open up a tab to listen to your Pandora music.  You can get to it from your new Pandora icon next to the address bar.  This extension also comes with commands that you can access from the address bar making it easy to change songs, stations, play, or pause from any webpage that you are on.
