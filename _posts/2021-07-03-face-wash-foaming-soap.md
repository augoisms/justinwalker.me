After trying different ratios, I settled on one that I like. The recipe below is foamy yet still creamy.

## Recipe

Mix the following ingredients:

- 200mL distilled water
- 100mL soap

## Notes

- I've used both Neutrogena Oil Free Face Wash and the generic version from Target.
- This works great in a cheap foaming soap pump that you get at any store.
- Don't skip the distilled water.
- Because the Neutrogena soap is so gelatinous, you'll need a whisk to get a proper mix.
