Me along with thousands of other Netflix customers are not too happy about Netflix's decision to split their streaming and DVD-by-mail business into two separate companies. Â The ever genius Matthew Inman over at <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/netflix">The Oatmeal</a> captured just how I feel.

UPDATE: It looks like Netflix has <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/10/dvds-will-be-staying-at-netflixcom.html">listened</a> to the uproar from it's customers and is no longer splitting the company. FTW!
