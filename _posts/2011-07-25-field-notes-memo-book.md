I just order a 3-pack of these pocket size memo books from Field Notes.  I received one of these as a gift for making a donation and I really like it alot! It's perfect for writing down quick notes or sketches.  When ever I pull out my full-size notebooks I find that I rarely fill up a whole page.  I really like the retro feel/style that these notebooks have. On their website they also have state fair editions that represent each of the 50 states which each coming in different colors. Way cool!
