For the last month I've been having issues with iCloud backup on my iPad.  The auto backups weren't happening, and even if I attempted a manual backup, I would get an error that said "There was a problem completing the backup."  After pouring over what felt like hundreds of pages, I finally found a solution that worked!  Here is the solution from this <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/16370650#16370650">Apple forum page</a>
<blockquote>I finally have a complete back-up of my iPad2 to iCloud. This is what I did...
<ul>
	<li>Signed out of iCloud, then shut iPad down completely. After launching it, I signed back into iCloud. Pushed Back Up Now button and it backed up for a while, but never completed.</li>
	<li>Go to Manage Storage, Selected iPad, then turned off all backup options. When back to Back Up Button and after about 20-minutes...I had a complete back-up.</li>
	<li>I've gone back and started turning back on the apps a few at a time, then selecting Back Up and continue to get complete back-ups.</li>
</ul>
Good Luck!</blockquote>
After I turned off the backups for most of the apps (especially the largest ones) my iPad was able to successfully back up to iCloud.  I am now in the process of slowing adding the apps back in a few at time.
