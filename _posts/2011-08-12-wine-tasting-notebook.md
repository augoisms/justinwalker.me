Today I just stumbled upon this great notebook called 33 Bottles of Wine.  It's a wine tasting notebook where you can record information about whine you've tasted such as varietal, vintage, flavor profiles, price, etc.  I've actually been working on an online wine database program for a while now. It's been a slow process, but in until I have it complete, this is a great option!!  This company also sells similar tasting notebooks for <a href="http://www.33coffees.com/">Coffee</a>, <a href="http://www.33beers.com/">Beer</a>, and <a href="http://www.33cigars.com/">Cigars</a>.  They're printed on recycled paper and made in Portland, OR. Definitely check them out!!
