I’m definitely going to keep my eye on this one.  It looks like a wonderful, minimalist desktop email client.  It’s been described as a mashup of tweetie and gmail.  I haven’t downloaded it yet because of as right now it only supports gmail, but general IMAP support is coming soon. If it will be able to duplicate the threading feature of gmail for regular IMAP accounts I will be sold.
