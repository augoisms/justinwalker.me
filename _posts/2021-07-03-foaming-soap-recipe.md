After much trial and error, I settled upon a soap recipe that works great in my Simplehuman foaming soap pumps. I've been using this for almost a year now.

## Recipe

Mix the following ingredients:

- 1 cup distilled water
- 5 tablespoons Castile soap
- 1 tablespoon glycerin

## Notes

- I use Dr Bronner's Castile soap.
- Don't skip the distilled water. If you use tap water your soap will eventually become cloudy and have a sort of off scent. I tried using reverse osmosis water and still had the same results, so distilled water is key!
- Don't skip the glycerin. This acts as a preservative and a humectant.
