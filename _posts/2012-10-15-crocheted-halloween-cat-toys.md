I recently saw some crocheted cat toy rings on Etsy and decided to make a bunch for all the cats in my life (I only have one in case you're wondering). I bought some orange and green wool yarn.  You'll need something round to crochet on. I used jelly braclettes.  You can get a grip of them for $6 on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZJKTJK/">Amazon</a>.  It was a little awkward at first crocheting around the ring, but this <a href="http://www.anniescatalog.com/crochet/content.html?content_id=69">video</a> helped me out.  Once I got the hang of it, it only took me about 5-10 minutes to do a single ring.  This is a very simple project and your cat will get lots of enjoyment out of it
